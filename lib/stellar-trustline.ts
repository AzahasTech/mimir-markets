/**
 * The one setup step between a fresh Stellar wallet and staking: a USDC
 * trustline.
 *
 * ── What this replaces ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The EVM version of this file created a Base Account **sub account** and held a
 * scoped P256 key in browser storage, purely so `approve(USDC)` and the stake
 * could be sent as one ERC-5792 batch and mirroring did not cost two wallet
 * prompts per position.
 *
 * On Soroban that entire mechanism has nothing to optimise. Authorisation is per
 * invocation: `challenge_claim` carries auth permitting exactly one USDC transfer
 * of exactly the staked amount, so there is no allowance to pre-grant and no
 * second transaction to batch with. **Staking is one signature, for every wallet,
 * with no setup.** The sub account, the browser-held key and the batch are all
 * deleted rather than ported — there is no custody question left to answer.
 *
 * What is left is a genuine first-time step: a Stellar account can only hold USDC
 * once it has a trustline to the issuer. That is a classic `changeTrust`
 * operation.
 *
 * ── Why it is NOT one transaction with the stake ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious design — one envelope holding `changeTrust` + the contract
 * invocation, one signature — is impossible, and not because of an SDK gap.
 * A Stellar transaction carrying a Soroban operation must carry EXACTLY ONE
 * operation, at the protocol level. Verified against the installed
 * `@stellar/stellar-sdk` 16.2.0 rather than assumed:
 *
 *   node_modules/@stellar/stellar-sdk/lib/esm/rpc/transaction.js
 *     isSorobanTransaction(): `if (tx.operations.length !== 1) return false`
 *     assembleTransaction():  throws TypeError
 *       "unsupported transaction: must contain exactly one invokeHostFunction,
 *        extendFootprintTtl, or restoreFootprint operation"
 *     and, in `assembleTransaction`'s own comment:
 *       "in soroban contract tx, there can only be single operation in the tx"
 *
 * `TransactionBuilder.addOperation()` will happily accept both — the builder does
 * not enforce it — so this fails at simulation, or at stellar-core, not at build
 * time. Which is exactly why it is written down here.
 *
 * So the flow is: add the trustline (one signature, once per account, classic
 * transaction), then stake (one signature, every time, Soroban transaction).
 * Worst case for a brand-new account is two signatures TOTAL, once — better than
 * the EVM path's two per stake, and it needs no key custody at all.
