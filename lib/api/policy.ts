/**
 * Access tiers for API routes (#11).
 *
 * Four kinds of caller reach these routes and they need different things checked.
 * Before this, each route decided for itself — which is how one of them ends up
 * reading a secret from the wrong header, or forgetting a rate limit, and nobody
 * notices because there is no single place to look.
 *
 *   public_read        anyone, including an OG scrapper with no session
 *   authenticated_user a wallet acting for itself
 *   registered_agent   an agent acting under a signed, replay-protected envelope
 *   internal_worker    a cron or worker holding the shared secret
 *
 * The rules that make this worth having:
 *
 *  - **A tier declares its requirements; a route only names its tier.** A route
 *    cannot accidentally be laxer than its tier, because it does not get to
 *    choose.
 *  - **Money- or authority-changing calls demand an idempotency key** at any tier
 *    above public read. A retried payment without one is a second payment.
 *  - **The secret comparison is length-checked and constant-time-ish.** A plain
 *    `===` on a secret leaks its length through timing; that is a small leak, but
 *    it is free to avoid.
 *  - **A missing configured secret refuses everything.** An unset CRON_SECRET must
 *    not mean "no auth required" — that turns a deploy mistake into an open
 *    endpoint.
