/**
 * Memoizes council reasoning per (claim, persona).
 *
 * The prompt is built only from a claim's question and its two sides — all
 * immutable once the claim exists — so the same pair always regenerates the same
 * kind of text. In production 13K paid reads burned 22 minutes of active CPU (plus
 * 13K LLM calls) for four distinct pairs, because the traffic generator hammers
 * claimId=1 across four personas.
 *
 * This caches the *generation*, never the HTTP response: the route still runs the
 * HTTP 402 payment gate on every read, so each reader keeps paying the persona's wallet. Do not
 * turn this into a Cache-Control header — that would serve paid content for free.
 *
 * ponytail: per-instance Map. Fluid reuses instances so the hit rate is high; move
 * it to Neon only if cross-instance misses show up as real LLM spend.
